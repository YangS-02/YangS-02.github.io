Spectral Properties of Random Matrices
Overview
This repository contains Python code exploring the Marchenko-Pastur distribution and its application to random matrix theory and stock return modeling. Additionally, it includes simulations comparing distributions (e.g., Studentâ€™s t-distribution and normal distribution) and evaluating their impact on key results.
Features
* Simulation of Marchenko-Pastur Law with Normal entries;
* Simulation of Marchenko-Pastur Law with Student-t entries;
* Simulation of Marchenko-Pastur Law with classical model for stock returns Y = beta x^T + E:
