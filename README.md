# Shuai Yang’s Project Portfolio
Welcome to my project portfolio! This page highlights key academic and personal projects I've worked on, ranging from data structure implementation to statistical modeling and spectral analysis. Each project highlights my ability to combine theoretical understanding with practical problem-solving. Below, you’ll find detailed descriptions and links to project files. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!

## Binary Search Tree Data Structure Implementation
### Overview:
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage cars for a used car dealership. Each car has a defined make, model, year, and price. Cars are organized in the BST where nodes are sorted lexicographically by make and model. Within each node, cars with the same make and model are stored in a Python list, preserving their insertion order.

The system also supports adding, managing, and removing cars efficiently while maintaining the BST property. Thorough testing ensures correctness and robustness of the implementation.

## Spectral Properties of Random Matrices
Overview
This [repository](https://github.com/YangS-02/YangS-02.github.io) contains Python code exploring the Marchenko-Pastur distribution and its application to random matrix theory and stock return modeling. Additionally, it includes simulations comparing distributions (e.g., Student’s t-distribution and normal distribution) and evaluating their impact on key results.
